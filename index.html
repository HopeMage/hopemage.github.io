      <h1>HopeMage's Action Plan</h1>
      <div id="intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        The purpose of this website is to outline a strategy<br>
        for creating new space on the Internet to support civilizational development.<br>
        <br>
        Knowledge is the basic foundation of human society. In order to advance the development of human civilization,<br>
        both the quantity and quality of knowledge must improve, especially in relative proportion to wrong information.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, creating new sources of high quality information to expand human knowledge is required.<br>

      <div id="priorities">
        <h2>Priorities</h2>
        1. Increase quantity and quality of available information online.<br>
        2. Spread awareness of what is happening around the world.<br>
        3. Maintain efforts through self-funding operations.<br>
        4. Support related programs and networks.<br>
        5. Advance civilization.<br>

      <div id="features">
        <h2>Features</h2>
        Ideas for a new online platform of the above type are described below.<br>
        
        <h3>Knowledge Repository</h3>
        Self-explanatory. A knowledge platform must have a store of knowledge, information, and data.<br>
        
        <h3>Structured Data Objects</h3>
        Knowledge should be formally structured while still easily readable by humans.<br>
        This will improve parsing and contextual analysis of information over simple text.<br>
        
        <h3>Traceable Sources</h3>
        Data provenance and verification are fundamental requirements for the maintenance of high quality knowledge.<br>
        Sources of information must be clearly referenced and organized.<br>
        
        <h3>Data Object Versioning</h3>
        The history of changes and updates to data objects should be recorded for user attribution.<br>

        <h3>Category Labels</h3>
        Organization filters which span across data models. For example, a label for "climate"<br>
        which can be used to tag relevant weather events, cities, businesses, people, etc.<br>

        <h3>Deduplication</h3>
        Rather than duplicating the same data object multiple times across different instances,<br>
        centralize to a singular instance with multiple contact vectors.

        <h3>Ratings</h3> 
        Evaluation of data objects can provide statistical context and meta information about the data itself.<br>
        Voting format(s) should be carefully designed. More sophistication than simple up and/or down votes would be preferable.<br>

        <h3>Discussion Graph</h3>
        Communication should be structured in a n-to-n format, rather than in a list or tree.<br>
        Entries can have multiple parents and multiple children.<br>
      
        <h3>Meritocratic Trustworthiness</h3>
        User permissions should be based on the quality of their contributions.<br>
        Making positive contributions should be rewarded, while negative contributions should be punished.<br>

      <div id="sustainability">
        <h2>Sustainability</h2>
        In order to meet project goals, the platform must have longevity. Therefore it must be sustainable.<br>
        Rather than maximizing growth or profits, keeping costs low while maintaining sufficient revenue should be the priority.<br>
        The platform should be self-funding and not rely on donations.<br>
        <br>
        Creating revenue likely requires some mix of premium memberships and paid advertising.<br>
        Attention must be given to ensure that financialization does not compromise the platform's overall mission.<br>

      <div id="plan">
        <h2>Plan</h2>
        1. Publish this document.<br>
        2. Develop prototype with the above features.<br>
        3. Launch prototype online.<br>
        4. Invite users.<br>
        5. Grow platform based on feedback.<br>
