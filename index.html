      <h1>HopeMage's Action Plan</h1>
      <div id="intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        The purpose of this website is to outline a strategy<br>
        for creating new space on the Internet to support civilizational development.<br>
        <br>
        Knowledge is the basic foundation of human society. In order to advance the development of human civilization,<br>
        both the quantity and quality of knowledge must improve, especially in relative proportion to wrong information.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, creating new sources of high quality information to expand human knowledge is required.<br>

      <div id="features">
        <h2>Features</h2>
        Ideas for a new online platform of the above type are described below.<br>
        
        <h3>Knowledge Repository</h3>
        Self-explanatory. A knowledge platform must have a store of knowledge, information, and data.<br>
        
        <h3>Structured Data Objects</h3>
        Knowledge should be formally structured while still easily readable by humans.<br>
        This will improve parsing and contextual analysis of information over simple text.<br>
        
        <h3>Data Versioning</h3>
        The history of changes and updates to data objects should be recorded for user attribution.<br>
        
        <h3>Traceable Sources</h3>
        Data provenance and verification are fundamental requirements for the maintenance of high quality knowledge.<br>
        Sources of information must be clearly referenced and organized. Information can also be rated by voting users.<br>
        
        <h3>Discussion Graph</h3>
        Communication should be structured in a n-to-n format, rather than in a list or tree.<br>
        Entries can have multiple parents and multiple children.<br>
