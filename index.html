      <div id="intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        The purpose of this website is to outline a strategy<br>
        for developing and maintaining new space on the Internet<br>
        to support positive civilizational development into the future.<br>
        <br>
        Knowledge is the basic foundation of human society.<br>
        <br>
        In order to advance the development of human civilization,<br>
        both the quantity and quality of knowledge must improve,<br>
        especially in relative proportion to wrong information.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore,<br>
        creating new sources of high quality information<br>
        to expand human knowledge is required.<br>

      <div id="priorities">
        <h2>Priorities</h2>
        1. Advance human civilization.<br><br>
        2. Improve the quantity and quality of available information.<br><br>
        3. Grow awareness of the active state of the world.<br><br>
        4. Establish self-funding operations with continuous improvement.<br><br>
        5. Support other programs and networks with similar objectives.<br>

      <div id="features">
        <h2>Features</h2>
        Ideas for a new online platform to meet the above goals are described below.<br>
        
        <h3>Knowledge Repository</h3>
        A knowledge platform must have a store of useful knowledge, information, and data.<br>
        
        <h3>Structured Data Objects</h3>
        Knowledge should be formally structured while still easily readable by humans.<br>
        This will improve parsing and contextual analysis of information over simple text.<br>
        
        <h3>Traceable Sources</h3>
        Data provenance and verification are fundamental requirements for the maintenance of high quality knowledge.<br>
        Sources of information must be clearly referenced and organized.<br>
        
        <h3>Data Object Versioning</h3>
        Changes and updates to data objects should be recorded for historical context and user attribution.<br>

        <h3>Category Labels</h3>
        Organizational tags spanning across data models. For example, a label for « climate »<br>
        which could be used to connect related weather events, technologies, people, etc.<br>

        <h3>Deduplication</h3>
        Rather than duplicating the same data object multiple times across different channels,<br>
        data should be centralized to a singular instance with multiple connecting vectors.

        <h3>Ratings</h3> 
        Evaluation of data objects can provide statistical context and meta information about the data itself.<br>
        Voting format(s) should be carefully designed. More sophistication than simple up and/or down votes would be preferable.<br>

        <h3>Discussion Graph</h3>
        Communication should be structured as n-to-n, rather than in a list or tree format.<br>
        Like in a mesh, entries should be able to have both multiple parents and children.<br>
      
        <h3>Meritocratic Trustworthiness</h3>
        User permissions should be based on the quality of their contributions.<br>
        Positive contributions should be rewarded, while negative contributions should be curtailed.<br>

      <div id="sustainability">
        <h2>Sustainability</h2>
        In order to meet project goals, the platform must have longevity. Therefore it must be sustainable.<br>
        Rather than maximizing growth or profits, keeping costs low while<br>
        earning sufficient revenue to maintain operations should be the priority.<br>
        <br>
        The platform should be self-funding and not rely on donations.<br>
        <br>
        Creating revenue likely requires some mix of premium memberships and paid advertising.<br>
        Attention must be given to ensure that financialization does not compromise the platform's overall mission.<br>

        <h2>Plan</h2>
        1. Publish this document.<br>
        2. Develop prototype with the features listed above.<br>
        3. Launch prototype online.<br>
        4. Invite users to experiment with the platform.<br>
        5. Grow platform based on user feedback.<br>
