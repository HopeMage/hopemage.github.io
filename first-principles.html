      <div>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        This page outlines the reasoning which provides<br>
        a foundation and motives for the <a href="https://hopemage.github.io/">Hope Action Plan</a>.<br>

        <h2>Motivations</h2>
        The basic foundations of ethics and morality teach us to care about the well-being of others.<br>
        « Well-being » means general health and happiness.<br>
        The opposite of well-being is « suffering ».<br>
        <br>
        There is simply too much suffering in the world still.<br>
        This general suffering must be reduced in order to improve global well-being.<br>
        <br>
        The overarching hope is to meaningfully improve the overall well-being of the world.<br>
        Everything that follows is simply to fulfill that hope.<br>

        <h2>Expansion</h2>
        Prioritizing the reduction of suffering is sometimes called « negative utilitarianism ».<br>
        Another related philosophy is called « effective altruism ».<br>
        <br>
        Suffering is not the only concern, but just the opening step.<br>
        Despite the current level of development, human civilization still has much unfulfilled potential.<br>
        We must look not just to suffering but also far beyond to fulfilling the potential of humanity.<br>
