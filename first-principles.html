        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        (What is this page meant to be? A blog post, an essay, a rant?)<br><br>
        On this page I hope to begin outlining the specific reasoning<br>
        which underlies and motivates the overall plan described <a href="https://hopemage.github.io/">here</a>.<br>
        <br>
        That is to say, it provides the foundation of the whole endeavor.<br>

        <h2>Motivations</h2>
        The hope of this author is simply to improve the state of the world in meaningful ways.<br>
        Everything that follows is attempting to fulfill that hope.<br>
        <br>
        <!---Despite the current level of development, human civilization still has much unfulfilled potential.<br>
        Quite frankly, there is still too much suffering in the world.<br>
