      <h1>First Principles</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        (What is this page meant to be? A blog post, an essay, a rant?)<br><br>
        On this page I hope to begin outlining the specific reasoning<br>
        which underlies and motivates the overall plan described <a href="https://hopemage.github.io/">here</a>.<br>
        <!--<br>That is to say, it provides the foundation of the whole endeavor.<br>-->

        <h2>Motivations</h2>
        The overarching hope is to meaningfully improve the state of the world.<br>
        Everything that follows is simply to fulfill that hope.<br>
        <br>
        The basic foundations of ethics and morality teach us to care about the well-being of others.<br>
        Well-being means general health and happiness. Suffering is the opposite of well-being.<br>
        <br>
        Quite frankly, there is still too much suffering in the world.<br>
        This general suffering must be reduced in order to improve global well-being.<br>

        <h2>Expansion</h2>
        Prioritizing the reduction of suffering is sometimes called negative utilitarianism.<br>
        Another related philosophy is called effective altruism.<br>
        <br>
        Suffering is not the only concern, but just the opening step.<br>
        Despite the current level of development, human civilization still has much unfulfilled potential.<br>
        We must look not just to suffering but also far beyond to fulfilling the potential of humanity.<br>
