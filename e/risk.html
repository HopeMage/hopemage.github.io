        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        This page discusses the important topic of risk.

        <h2>Definition</h2>
        Risk is a type of potential for an outcome, generally of negative consequences.<br>
        Being aware of risk, containing it, and managing the response to risk<br>
        are key to success, or at least avoiding failure.<br>
        
        <h2>Classification</h2>
        Risks are often categorized by <b>severity</b> and <b>probability</b>.<br>
        The most urgent risks are both very severe and probable,<br>
        while the least worrisome are minor and unlikely.<br>
        <br>
        In between the most and least alarming risks is a range of intermediary<br>
        risks with varying combinations of severities and probabilities.<br>
        <br>
        They can also be categorized by <b>detectability</b>.<br>
        A hidden risk that is not very detectable can be more dangerous,<br>
        even if the severity and/or probability are only moderate.<br>
        
        <h2>Management</h2>
        Dealing with risks involves multiple steps:<br>
        identification, analysis, prioritization, and mitigation.<br>
        <br>
