      <h1>First Principles</h1>
      <div>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        This page outlines the motivational foundations of the <a href="https://hopemage.github.io/">Hope Action Plan</a>.<br>

        <h2>Motivations</h2>
        Basic ethics and morality teach us to care about the « well-being » of others,<br>
        which means their general health and happiness.<br>
        <!--TBD: expansion on society-->
        <br>
        The opposite of well-being is « suffering »<br>
        of which there is simply too much still in the world.<br>
        This general suffering must be reduced in order to improve global well-being.<br>
        <br>
        The overarching hope is to meaningfully improve the overall well-being of the world.<br>
        Everything that follows is simply to fulfill that hope.<br>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Expansion</h2>
        Prioritizing the reduction of suffering is sometimes called « negative utilitarianism ».<br>
        Another related philosophy is « effective altruism »<br>
        which aims to do the most good per resource consumed.<br>
        <br>
        However, suffering is only the opening step and not the sole concern.<br>
        Despite the current level of development, human civilization still has much unfulfilled potential.<br>
        We must look not just to reducing suffering but also far beyond it to fulfilling the potential of humanity.<br>
