      <h1>Fermi Paradox and Job Searching</h1>
      <div>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
          The "Fermi Paradox" is the question of why no alien life has been found despite the universe being so vast.<br>
          Similarly, the world economy contains so many businesses and industries, but jobs can be scarce.<br>
          Why is finding a job so hard if there are so many job openings?<br>
          <br>
          A way to answer the Fermi Paradox is provided by the "Drake Equation":<br>
          N = (R) x (fp) x (ne) x (fl) x (fi) x (fc) x (L)<br><br>
          A detailed explanation of the Drake Equation would be too long here, but for more information check out:<br>

          <br>
          This approach can be adapted for solving the job search problem.<br>

        <h2>Job Search Process</h2>
        There are multiple phases in a typical hiring process which need to be successfully passed by the applicant:<br><br>
        <h3>Application (Resume and Cover Letter)</h3>
        Preparing the application is the initial phase in which the job seeker is fully in control.<br>
        No one can reject the application at this phase except the applicant themself.<br>
        <br>
        Keep in mind some basics:<br>
        The <u>resume</u> is 100% about the candidate.<br>
        Tthe <u>job requirements</u> are 100% about the employer.<br>
        The <u>cover letter</u> is the bridge connecting the resume and job requirements.<br>
