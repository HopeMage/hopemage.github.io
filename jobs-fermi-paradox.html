      <h1>Fermi Paradox and Job Searching</h1>
      <div>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
          The "Fermi Paradox" is the question of why no alien life has been found despite the universe being so vast.<br>
          Similarly, the world economy contains so many businesses and industries, but jobs can be scarce.<br>
          Why is finding a job so hard if there are so many job openings?<br>
          <br>
          A way to answer the Fermi Paradox is provided by the "Drake Equation":<br>
          N = (R) x (fp) x (ne) x (fl) x (fi) x (fc) x (L)<br><br>
          A detailed explanation of the Drake Equation would be too long here, but for more information check out:<br>

          <br>
          This approach can be adapted for solving the job search problem.<br>

        <h2>Job Search Process</h2>
          There are multiple phases in a typical hiring process which need to be successfully passed by the applicant:<br>
          <h3>Resume and Cover Letter</h3>
            Preparing the application is the initial phase in which the job seeker is fully in control.<br>
            No one can reject the application at this phase except the applicant themself.<br>
            <br>
            Keep in mind some basics:<br>
            The <u>resume</u> is 100% about the candidate.<br>
            Tthe <u>job requirements</u> are 100% about the employer.<br>
            The <u>cover letter</u> is the bridge connecting the resume and job requirements.<br>
          
          <h3>Applicant Tracking System (ATS)</h3>
            The applicant tracking system is the online platform which receives the job application.<br>
            It performs the initial automated screening based on set parameters to remove spam before any humans see it.<br>
            Nowadays, it may be more common for increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence screening to be used as part of the ATS.<br>
          
          <h3>Human Resources (HR) Screen</h3>
            Recruiters and human resources staff are usually the first humans to actually review a new job application.<br>
            They will screen for basic eligibility and fit between the job requirements and candidate based on their application.<br>
          
          <h3>Phone interviews</h3>
            For serious candidates who have a chance of getting hired, the employer will request they do phone interviews.<br>
            There will usually be a HR phone interview followed by another phone interview with the hiring manager.<br>
            Phone interviews are basic checks requiring a low time commitment from both employer and candidate.<br>
            Questions on phone interviews will verify basic job requirements and may gauge salary and personality fit.<br>
            If the candidate passes the phone interview(s), the next step will usually be an invitation for on-site interviews.<br>

          <h3>On-site interviews</h3>
            The on-site interviews are generally the most important and intimidating phase of the job application process.<br>
            Interviews may last for multiple back-to-back sessions and span for an entire day or multiple days.<br>
            There may be multiple "rounds" of interviews spread over weeks or months, depending on the number of candidates<br>
            and the complexity of scheduling or the job requirements of the role.<br>
            In many cases, the final interview may be with the hiring manager's boss, who can approve or veto the decision.<br>
