      <h1>Fermi Paradox and Job Searching</h1>
      <div>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
          The "Fermi Paradox" is the question of why no alien life has been found despite the universe being so vast.<br>
          Similarly, the world economy contains so many businesses and industries, but jobs can be scarce.<br>
          Why is finding a job so hard if there are so many job openings?<br>
          <br>
          A way to answer the Fermi Paradox is provided by the "Drake Equation":<br>
          N = (R) x (fp) x (ne) x (fl) x (fi) x (fc) x (L)<br>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation</a><br>
          <br>
          This equation can be adapted to solving the job search problem.<br>

        <h2>Job Searching</h2>
        There are multiple phases in a typical hiring process which need to be passed by the applicant in order to secure the job:<br><br>
        Resume and cover letter<br>
        Applicant Tracking System (ATS)<br>
        HR screen<br>
        Phone interviews<br>
        On-site interviews<br>
        Professional references<br>
        Background check<br>
        Offer negotiation<br>
