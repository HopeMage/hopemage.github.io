        Risk is a type of potential for an outcome, generally of negative consequences.<br>
        Being aware of risk, containing it, and managing the response to risk<br>
        are key to success, or at least avoiding failure.<br>
        
        <h2>Classification</h2>
        Risks are often categorized by <b>severity</b> and <b>probability</b>.<br>
        The most urgent risks are both very severe and probable,<br>
        while the least worrisome are minor and unlikely.<br>
        <br>
        In between the most and least alarming risks is a range of risks<br>
        with varying intermediary combinations of severities and probabilities.<br>
